  <p>This API is for a basic calculator. The game simply implements Tic Tac Toe for two players. When you include Calc.js a global variable is created called calculator. All methods should be called on this object. For example, we can insert the number 3 using the <strong>calculator.addNumber(3)</strong> Below you can find the API:<br /><br /></p>
